Masculinity Survey Cumulative Project

Welcome to the cumulative project for clustering! In this project, you will use a survey done by 538 to find patterns in the way men view masculinity.

To complete this project, you will be working in a Jupyter Notebook. Follow these instructions to set up your project:
Getting Started with Jupyter Notebooks

    If you’ve never used the command line, we recommend taking the Learn the Command Line course.
    Install Python by following the directions in this article on Installing Python for Data Analysis.
    Learn about Jupyter Notebooks, a cool way of combining Python code with explanations or instruction in a web terminal.
    Download the Masculinity project.
    Unzip it by double-clicking on it.
    In the terminal, navigate to the directory containing the project, and type:

    jupyter notebook

    This should open a browser tab.
    Click on Masculinity_Project.ipynb to open the Notebook.
    Part of the project will ask you to look at masculinity-survey.pdf. You can open this PDF by double clicking on it in your computer's file system — not in the Notebook browser tab.
    Follow the steps in the Jupyter Notebook. If you get stuck, you can look at the solution found in Masculinity_Project_Solution.ipynb at any time.

If you are stuck on the project or would like to see an experienced developer work through the project, watch the following project walkthrough video!
