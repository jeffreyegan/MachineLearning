Twitter Classification Cumulative Project

Welcome to the cumulative project for classification! In this project, you will use real tweets to find patterns in the way people use social media.

There are two parts to this project that can be done in either order.

In the first part, you will make a system that predicts whether or not a tweet will go viral by using a K-Nearest Neighbor classifier. What features of a tweet do you think are the most important in determining its virality? Does the length of the tweet matter? What about the number of hashtags? Maybe information about the account that sent the tweet is most important. You’ll answer these questions while using DataFrames and Matplotlib visualizations to present your results!

In the second part of this project, you’ll test the power of Naive Bayes classifiers by creating a system that predicts whether a tweet was sent from New York City, London, or Paris. You will investigate how language is used differently in these three cities. Can the classifier automatically detect the difference between French and English? Can it learn local phrases or slang? Can you create tweets that trick the system?

To complete this project, you will be working in a Jupyter Notebook. Follow these instructions to set up your project:
Getting Started with Jupyter Notebooks

    If you’ve never used the command line, we recommend taking the Learn the Command Line course.
    Install Python by following the directions in this article on Installing Python for Data Analysis.
    Learn about Jupyter Notebooks, a cool way of combining Python code with explanations or instruction in a web terminal.
    Download the Twitter project.
    Unzip it by double-clicking on it.
    In the terminal, navigate to the directory containing the project, and type:

    jupyter notebook

    This should open a browser tab.
    The two parts of the project are found in tweet_location.ipynb and viral_tweets.ipynb. Click on either to begin one part of the project. You can go back to this browser tab to start the other part at any time.
    Follow the steps in the Jupyter Notebook. If you get stuck, you can look at the solution found in either tweet_location_solution.ipynb or viral_tweets_solution.ipynb.

If you are stuck on the project or would like to see an experienced developer work through the project, watch the following project walkthrough video!
